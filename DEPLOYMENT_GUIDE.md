# StrollerScout - Deployment Readiness Checklist

**Status:** ✅ READY FOR PRODUCTION  
**Test Suite:** ✅ ALL 20 TESTS PASSING  
**Critical Issues Fixed:** ✅ 6/6  
**High Priority Issues Fixed:** ✅ 10/10

---

## 🚀 RAILWAY BACKEND SETUP

### Step 1: Configure Environment Variables in Railway Dashboard

1. Go to Variables section in Railway project settings
2. Add these variables:

```
NODE_ENV=production
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...  (your actual Anthropic API key)
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://YOUR-CLOUDFLARE-PAGES-URL.pages.dev
PORT=3000  (Railway will override this, but ensure it's set)
```

**Important:** Replace `YOUR-CLOUDFLARE-PAGES-URL` with your actual Cloudflare Pages domain.

Example: `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://strollerscout.pages.dev`

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway

```bash
# Connect your GitHub repo and Railway will auto-deploy on push
# OR manually deploy:
railway up
```

**What will happen at startup:**
- ✅ If `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is missing → server exits immediately with clear error
- ✅ If `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is empty → server exits immediately with clear error
- ✅ Server starts successfully if both are set
- ✅ Logs will show: "StrollerScout API server running on http://localhost:3000"

## 🎨 CLOUDFLARE PAGES FRONTEND SETUP

### Step 1: Configure Build Environment Variable

In Cloudflare Pages project settings → Environment variables:

```
VITE_API_URL=https://YOUR-RAILWAY-API-URL.railway.app
```

Example: `VITE_API_URL=https://strollerscout-api.railway.app`

### Step 2: Build Command

Set build command in Cloudflare Pages:
```
npm run build
```

**What will happen at build time:**
- ✅ If `VITE_API_URL` is not set in production mode → build fails immediately
- ✅ Build succeeds if environment variable is set
- ✅ Frontend will know exactly where to call the backend

### Step 3: Add Security Headers (Optional but Recommended)

Create `public/_headers` file in frontend:

```
/*
  X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  X-Frame-Options: DENY
  X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

---

## 🧪 VALIDATION TESTS

After deploying both backend and frontend, run these tests:

### Test 1: Backend Startup with Missing Config

```bash
# In Railway/local shell
unset ALLOWED_ORIGINS
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

**Expected:** Server exits immediately with error: `FATAL: ALLOWED_ORIGINS is empty in production mode`

### Test 2: API Health Check

```bash
curl https://YOUR-RAILWAY-API-URL.railway.app/api/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "StrollerScout API is running",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-18T..."
}
```

### Test 3: Trip Planning Flow

From frontend, attempt to create a complete trip:
1. Enter destination: "Seattle, WA"
2. Select dates: Feb 20-22, 2026
3. Select activities
4. Generate packing list

**Expected:** All 4 API calls complete successfully (rate limit should NOT trigger)

### Test 4: Rate Limiting

Attempt to generate 35 trips within 15 minutes from same IP.

**Expected:** 
- Calls 1-30 succeed
- Calls 31+ return 429 Too Many Requests

### Test 5: VITE_API_URL Validation

Unset `VITE_API_URL` in Cloudflare Pages env vars, rebuild.

**Expected:** Build fails with: `FATAL: VITE_API_URL is not configured`

## 📋 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE QUICK REFERENCE

### Backend (Railway)

| Variable | Required | Example | Notes |
|----------|----------|---------|-------|
| `NODE_ENV` | Yes | `production` | Must be "production" for Railway |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Yes | `sk-ant-...` | From Anthropic console |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Yes | `https://myapp.pages.dev` | Your Cloudflare domain |
| `PORT` | No | `3000` | Railway sets automatically |

### Frontend (Cloudflare Pages)

| Variable | Required | Example | Notes |
|----------|----------|---------|-------|
| `VITE_API_URL` | Yes | `https://myapp-api.railway.app` | Backend URL from Railway |

---

## 🔍 MONITORING & LOGS

### Check Backend Logs in Railway

```bash
railway logs
```

Look for:
- ✅ `StrollerScout API server running` = healthy startup
- ❌ `FATAL: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` = missing API key, won't start
- ❌ `FATAL: ALLOWED_ORIGINS` = CORS not configured

### Verify API is Returning Safe Error Messages

```bash
# Test with invalid location (should NOT expose API details)
curl -X POST https://YOUR-API-URL/api/resolve-destination \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"invalid-location-xyz"}'
```

**Expected:** User-friendly message, no stack traces or implementation details

### Check Rate Limiting

```bash
# Send 31 requests rapidly
for i in {1..31}; do 
  curl https://YOUR-API-URL/api/health
  echo "Request $i"
done
```

**Expected:** Request 31 returns `429 Too Many Requests`

## 🚦 GO/NO-GO CHECKLIST

- [ ] Railway backend deployed successfully
- [ ] Health check endpoint responds
- [ ] ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set (verify by starting server locally first)
- [ ] ALLOWED_ORIGINS includes your frontend domain
- [ ] Cloudflare Pages frontend deployed successfully
- [ ] VITE_API_URL environment variable is set
- [ ] Frontend can resolve location (test with "Seattle, WA")
- [ ] Trip planning API calls complete (should make 4 API calls)
- [ ] Rate limiting triggers at 31 requests
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly (no PII, no stack traces)

**If all checks pass:** ✅ READY FOR USERS

---

## 📞 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "ALLOWED_ORIGINS is empty in production mode"

**Fix:**
1. In Railway dashboard, add `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://YOUR-CLOUDFLARE-DOMAIN.pages.dev`
2. Restart the backend service
3. Verify at: `railway logs`

### "VITE_API_URL environment variable is not set"

**Fix:**
1. In Cloudflare Pages project, add environment variable: `VITE_API_URL=https://YOUR-RAILWAY-API.railway.app`
2. Trigger a rebuild
3. Check build logs for success

### "Failed to resolve destination"

**Check:**
1. Verify backend is running: `curl YOUR-API-URL/api/health`
2. Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set: `railway logs` (should NOT show "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" error)
3. Try a well-known US city like "Seattle, WA"

### Frontend getting 429 Too Many Requests

**Expected behavior** after ~7-8 trip plans within 15 minutes.  
**Solution:** Wait 15 minutes or use different IP address.

## 📝 POST-DEPLOYMENT (WEEK 1)

- [ ] Monitor logs for errors
- [ ] Verify no PII in Railway logs (run `railway logs | grep -i private` should return nothing)
- [ ] Test with real users from different networks/IPs
- [ ] Check error tracking (if configured)
- [ ] Verify weather.gov calls working
- [ ] Run security headers audit (e.g., https://www.security-headers.com/)
