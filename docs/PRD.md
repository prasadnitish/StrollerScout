# Product Requirements Document: StrollerScout (Web MVP)

**Project Name:** StrollerScout
**Version:** 1.0 (Web MVP)
**Author:** Nitish Prasad
**Date:** January 2026
**Status:** Planning

---

## Executive Summary

StrollerScout is an AI-powered trip planning tool for parents that transforms trip intent into a detailed itinerary and weather-appropriate packing list. This web-based MVP demonstrates API integration, AI orchestration, and product thinking for a TPM portfolio.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Situation

Parents planning trips with children face decision fatigue when packing:

- **Weather uncertainty** - Don't know what to pack without checking forecasts
- **Activity-specific needs** - Different activities require different gear
- **Forgotten items** - Easy to forget essential items in the rush
- **Shopping overwhelm** - Don't know what to buy if items are missing

### Target Users

- **Primary:** Parents with young children (0-5 years) planning domestic trips
- **Secondary:** Caregivers, grandparents taking kids on trips

### Pain Points

1. Spend 30+ minutes researching weather and making packing lists
2. Forget essential items (rain gear, sun protection, extra clothes)
3. Overpack out of uncertainty
4. Last-minute shopping trips before travel

---

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals

1. **Reduce packing planning time** from 30 minutes to 5 minutes
2. **Demonstrate TPM skills** - API integration, AI orchestration, product thinking
3. **Ship a polished prototype** within 1-2 weeks for portfolio

### Success Metrics (MVP)

- **Functional:** User can input trip details and receive AI-generated packing list
- **Technical:** Successfully integrates Weather.gov API and Claude API
- **UX:** Clear, simple interface that works on desktop and mobile browsers
- **Documentation:** Professional README, architecture docs, learnings

### Non-Goals (Out of Scope for MVP)

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies

- **Frontend:** React 18+ or Vanilla JS with modules
- **Backend:** Express.js, node-fetch
- **APIs:** @anthropic-ai/sdk, Weather.gov REST API
- **Utilities:** date-fns (date handling), dotenv (environment variables)

### API Rate Limits

- **Weather.gov:** No rate limit for reasonable use (recommended: cache for 1 hour)
- **Claude API:** Tier-dependent (starter tier sufficient for MVP)

### Risks & Mitigation

| Risk                         | Impact | Probability | Mitigation                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Weather API unavailable      | High   | Low         | Graceful fallback, cached data, error UI     |
| Claude API slow/rate limited | Medium | Medium      | Loading indicator, timeout after 15 seconds  |
| Non-US location entered      | Medium | High        | Clear error message, suggest US destinations |
| Browser local storage full   | Low    | Low         | Limit storage to 1 trip, clear old data      |

### Open Questions

- [ ] Should we support international locations in V2? (requires different weather API)
- [ ] How many past trips to save in local storage? (Suggest: 1 for MVP)
- [ ] Should we add a "shopping list" feature without Amazon integration? (Simple text export?)

### Technical Design: Car Safety Rules Engine (Proposed)

**Implementation Status:** **Not built** (design only, no matching backend service or frontend UI in current repo)

#### Goal

Provide trip-specific car seat and booster guidance by US jurisdiction using child age, weight, and height, while showing traceable legal sources and update metadata.

#### Scope (MVP for this subsystem)

- US state-level rules for rear-facing, forward-facing, booster, and seat belt transitions
- Child-level recommendations for each child profile in a trip
- Source-backed output with `sourceUrl`, `effectiveDate`, and `lastUpdated`
- Fallback states when jurisdiction data is unavailable or stale

#### Data Schema (proposed)

| Entity | Key Fields | Notes |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `safety_rule_set` | `id`, `jurisdictionCode`, `jurisdictionType`, `effectiveDate`, `version`, `status` | One active ruleset per jurisdiction/date window |
| `safety_rule` | `id`, `ruleSetId`, `priority`, `minAgeMonths`, `maxAgeMonths`, `minWeightLb`, `maxWeightLb`, `minHeightIn`, `maxHeightIn`, `requiredRestraint`, `seatPosition`, `text` | Structured condition + plain-language legal text |
| `safety_source` | `id`, `ruleSetId`, `sourceUrl`, `publisher`, `retrievedAt`, `lastVerifiedAt`, `citationSnippet`, `confidence` | Traceability and audit metadata |
| `safety_change_log` | `id`, `jurisdictionCode`, `previousVersion`, `newVersion`, `changeSummary`, `changedAt` | Supports monthly refresh and legal-change monitoring |

`requiredRestraint` enum (initial): `rear_facing`, `forward_facing_harness`, `booster`, `seat_belt`, `not_found`.

#### Ingestion and Refresh Pipeline (proposed)

1. Maintain a jurisdiction source registry (`state -> official source URL`).
2. Fetch source pages on a scheduled cadence (monthly) and on-demand for reported changes.
3. Parse and normalize legal text into structured thresholds (age/weight/height) plus exceptions.
4. Run validation checks:
   - Required metadata present (`effectiveDate`, `sourceUrl`, `version`)
   - Rule interval sanity (no invalid min/max ranges)
   - Overlap detection for conflicting thresholds within a jurisdiction
5. Publish new ruleset version and append changelog entry.
6. Mark prior version superseded but queryable for audit.

#### API Contract (proposed)

`POST /api/safety/car-seat-check`

Request:

```json
{
  "jurisdictionCode": "CA",
  "tripDate": "2026-06-15",
  "children": [
    { "id": "child-1", "ageMonths": 30, "weightLb": 30, "heightIn": 36 }
  ]
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "jurisdictionCode": "CA",
  "ruleSetVersion": "2026.05",
  "lastUpdated": "2026-05-20",
  "status": "Verified",
  "results": [
    {
      "childId": "child-1",
      "requiredRestraint": "forward_facing_harness",
      "seatPosition": "rear_seat_preferred",
      "rationale": "Based on CA thresholds for age/weight/height",
      "sourceUrl": "https://example.state.gov/carseat-law",
      "effectiveDate": "2025-01-01"
    }
  ]
}
```

Error contracts:

- `404` jurisdiction or rules not found -> return status `Unavailable`
- `422` invalid child input (missing age/weight/height)
- `503` upstream/source refresh unavailable -> return last known rules + stale flag when possible

#### UI States (proposed)

| State | Trigger | User-facing behavior |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `Loading` | Request in progress | Skeleton + "Checking local car seat rules..." |
| `Verified` | Rule match with current source metadata | Show recommendation, rationale, source link, effective date |
| `Needs review` | Rule exists but stale/low-confidence metadata | Show warning banner and prompt to re-check before travel |
| `Unavailable` | No ruleset for jurisdiction or request error | Show "Not found in repo data" style fallback and external resource link |

#### Integration Points (proposed)

- **Frontend:** add "Travel Safety" card in results view below weather/itinerary
- **Backend:** add `src/backend/services/safetyRules.js` and `/api/safety/car-seat-check`
- **Data:** introduce versioned safety rules store (JSON for MVP, DB in V2)

#### Acceptance Criteria (proposed)

- 95%+ of valid US state queries return a deterministic recommendation with source metadata
- Every rendered recommendation includes source URL and effective date
- Stale data always displays warning state and timestamp
- API p95 response time <= 500 ms using local rules store

## Market & Competitive Landscape (Research Update: February 15, 2026)

### Market Sizing (US-focused for MVP)

#### Evidence-based anchors

- **US population baseline:** 340,110,988 (July 1, 2024 estimate, US Census QuickFacts)
- **Children under 5:** 5.5% of US population (US Census QuickFacts)
- **Estimated children under 5 (derived):** ~18.7 million (`340,110,988 x 5.5%`)
- **Families with own children under 6:** 13.337 million in 2024 (BLS CPS Table 4, annual average)
- **Travel spend context:** US domestic leisure travel spend forecast to reach **$895B** in 2025 (US Travel Association forecast)

#### TAM / SAM / SOM model (planning assumptions)

Because StrollerScout is a pre-trip planning and packing workflow (not a booking engine), this PRD sizes opportunity by **households served**, with a secondary spend context.

- **TAM (households):** 13.337M US families with own children under 6
- **SAM (serviceable digital segment):** 4.7M to 8.0M households  
  Assumption: 35% to 60% of TAM are active domestic leisure travelers in a given year and reachable by mobile/web planning tools.
- **SOM (12-24 month target):** 33K to 133K households  
  Assumption: 0.25% to 1.0% TAM penetration via organic + partner channels.

#### Monetization scenario framing (for roadmap decisions)

If StrollerScout captures 33K to 133K households, with 1.5 planning cycles per household per year and $3 to $8 blended revenue per cycle (subscription, affiliate, or premium features), modeled annual revenue ranges from roughly **$149K to $1.6M**.

These are planning scenarios, not forecasts; they should be refined after MVP retention and conversion data.

### Top Players (Direct and Adjacent)

| Player | Evidence of Scale | Core Offer | Gap / Takeaway vs StrollerScout |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **TripIt** | 22M+ users (TripIt 20-year milestone) and 5M+ Android downloads | Itinerary aggregation from booking confirmations | Strong itinerary lock-in; less child-specific packing intelligence |
| **Wanderlog** | 1M+ Android downloads | Collaborative trip planning, maps, route planning | Strong planning collaboration; less focused on weather+kids packing workflow |
| **Roadtrippers** | 38M+ trips planned to date | Road trip routing/discovery; launched AI trip planner | Strong for drive trips and POI discovery; less family-young-kids packing specialization |
| **PackPoint** | 1M+ Android downloads; states 2M+ packing lists created yearly | Weather/activity-based packing lists | Most direct feature overlap; opportunity is richer family context + itinerary linkage |
| **BabyQuip (adjacent)** | 425K+ reservations, 2,000+ cities | Family travel gear rental marketplace | Potential partner/channel rather than pure feature competitor |

### SWOT Analysis: StrollerScout (MVP)

| Category | Details |
| ------ | ------ |
| **Strengths** | Clear niche (parents with children 0-5); combines destination intent, weather, itinerary, and packing in one flow; low-friction web MVP with no account required |
| **Weaknesses** | API dependency risk (Anthropic, Weather.gov, OSM); US-only weather coverage; no cross-device sync/account system in MVP |
| **Opportunities** | Partner integrations (family travel creators, baby gear services); premium family templates and reminders; expansion to international weather providers; B2B2C distribution with travel/hospitality partners |
| **Threats** | Incumbent planner apps adding AI packing; platform changes/rate limits; rising acquisition costs in consumer travel apps; user trust concerns around AI recommendation accuracy |

### Implications for Product Strategy

1. **Positioning:** Lead with "family-specific planning + weather-aware packing" instead of generic AI trip planning.
2. **Differentiation:** Prioritize child-age-aware templates, weather rationale transparency, and fast regeneration loops.
3. **Go-to-market:** Test partnerships with family travel communities and gear-rental ecosystems before paid acquisition.
4. **Defensibility:** Build compounding advantage from family trip patterns, checklist completion behavior, and saved preferences.

### SWOT Coverage Backlog (What to Add Next)

| Priority | Addition | Status | Why it covers SWOT gaps |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **P0** | Jurisdiction-specific car seat and booster rule checker | **Not built** | Converts safety risk into a differentiated trust feature for families |
| **P0** | Regulatory rules data pipeline (source URL + effective date + version) | **Not built** | Reduces legal/accuracy risk and supports auditable updates |
| **P0** | Safety recommendation transparency (citations, `last updated`, status tags) | **Not built** | Improves user trust and defensibility against generic AI tools |
| **P1** | Outage/stale-data fallback UX across weather and safety modules | **Not built** | Mitigates API dependency weakness and reliability threats |
| **P1** | Optional account + cloud sync | **Not built** | Closes cross-device weakness and improves retention |
| **P2** | Family profile memory + reusable templates | **Not built** | Increases repeat-use moat and lowers planning friction over time |
