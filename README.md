# StrollerScout 🧳

## Overview

## Codebase Objective

Build a reliable, explainable family-trip planner that converts fuzzy trip intent
into actionable outputs:
- A concrete destination
- A weather-aware itinerary
- A practical packing checklist
- A safety-guidance snapshot for child passenger rules

The implementation favors predictable API contracts, graceful fallbacks when
external services fail, and maintainable modules that are easy to test.

**Problem Statement:**
Parents planning trips with young children face decision fatigue when packing - uncertain weather, activity-specific needs, and the constant worry of forgetting essential items.

**Solution:**
StrollerScout is an AI-powered trip planning tool that generates smart, weather-appropriate packing lists for parents. It combines real-time weather forecasts with AI-generated recommendations to create personalized checklists.

**Target Audience:**
Parents with young children (0-5 years) planning domestic trips within the United States.

## Key Features

- **Smart Trip Input** - Step-by-step wizard for destination, dates, and kids
- **Natural-Language Location** - Accepts input like "2 hour drive from Seattle" and suggests destinations
- **Real-Time Weather** - 7-day forecast from Weather.gov API for accurate planning
- **AI Trip Plan + Packing List** - Claude AI generates a detailed itinerary and categorized packing recommendations
- **Interactive Checklist** - Check off items as you pack, with progress tracking
- **Local Storage** - Your packing list persists across browser sessions
- **Print-Friendly** - Print your list for offline reference
- **Mobile-Responsive** - Works seamlessly on phones, tablets, and desktops

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18 + Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **AI:** Claude API (Anthropic)
- **Weather:** Weather.gov API (National Weather Service)
- **Location:** OpenStreetMap Nominatim + Overpass API
- **Storage:** Browser Local Storage
- **Hosting:** Railway (backend) · Cloudflare Pages (frontend)

## Architecture

```
[React Wizard Frontend] → [Express API] → [Weather.gov API]
                              ↓
                      [OpenStreetMap APIs]
                              ↓
                          [Claude API]
                              ↓
                 [Itinerary + Packing List]
```

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed system design.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Claude API Key** - [Get one from Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prasadnitish/tpm-portfolio.git
cd tpm-portfolio/strollerscout
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
cd src/frontend && npm install
cd ../backend && npm install
cd ../..
```

3. **Set up environment variables**

```bash
cp src/backend/.env.example src/backend/.env
```

Edit `src/backend/.env` and add your Claude API key:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-actual-key-here
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

4. **Run the application**

```bash
./start.sh
```

Or run manually:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will start:

- **Frontend:** http://localhost:5173
- **Backend:** http://localhost:3000

## Usage

### Step 1: Enter Destination Intent

- Enter your destination (e.g., "Seattle, WA")
- Or type intent like "2 hour drive from Seattle"
- Choose one of the suggested destinations

### Step 2: Add Dates + Kids

- Select start and end dates (max 14 days)
- Add number of children and their ages

### Step 3: Generate Plan + Packing List

Click "Generate Plan" and wait 5-10 seconds while:

- Location is resolved to coordinates
- Weather forecast is fetched from Weather.gov
- AI generates a detailed itinerary
- AI generates personalized packing recommendations

### Step 4: Customize + Pack

- View weather forecast for your trip
- Customize activities to regenerate your packing list
- Check off items as you pack them
- Watch your progress bar fill up
- Collapse/expand categories as needed
- Print the list for offline use

## Project Learnings

### Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **API Integration** - Successfully integrated multiple external APIs (Weather.gov, Claude)
- **Full-Stack Development** - Built both React frontend and Express backend
- **AI/LLM Integration** - Implemented Claude API for structured JSON output
- **State Management** - Managed complex application state with React hooks
- **Data Persistence** - Implemented browser local storage for user data
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first UI with Tailwind CSS

### Product/TPM Skills Demonstrated

- **User Story Definition** - Created detailed PRD with acceptance criteria
- **System Design** - Documented architecture with clear trade-off analysis
- **Scope Management** - Made deliberate MVP vs V2 decisions (web vs mobile)
- **Technical Documentation** - Comprehensive README, PRD, and architecture docs
- **Risk Mitigation** - Identified and planned for API failures and edge cases

### Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1:** Weather.gov API requires lat/lon coordinates, not city names
**Solution:** Integrated OpenStreetMap's Nominatim geocoding API to convert "Seattle, WA" to coordinates and Overpass to suggest nearby destinations

**Challenge 2:** Claude API responses can be slow (3-5 seconds)
**Solution:** Added loading states, progress indicators, and clear user feedback

**Challenge 3:** Weather.gov only supports US locations
**Solution:** Clear error messaging and documented limitation in PRD as accepted technical debt for MVP

**Challenge 4:** Local storage has size limits
**Solution:** Limited to storing one trip at a time, with clear "Start Over" functionality

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Mobile app (React Native)
- [ ] User authentication and cloud sync
- [ ] International weather support (OpenWeatherMap API)
- [ ] Amazon product recommendations
- [ ] Trip templates and history
- [ ] Share packing lists with family
- [ ] Offline mode with cached data
- [ ] Push notifications for packing reminders

## Metrics (Targets)

- **API Response Time (target):** <10 seconds for itinerary + packing list
- **Weather Cache:** 1-hour TTL to reduce API calls
- **Bundle Size (target):** <200KB (frontend)
- **Browser Support:** Chrome, Safari, Firefox (latest versions)

## Security

- ✅ API keys stored in environment variables
- ✅ No secrets in git history
- ✅ Input validation on frontend and backend
- ✅ CORS configured for production
- ✅ React auto-escaping reduces XSS risk for rendered content
